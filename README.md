# MOCARTS
Monte Carlo Radiation Transport Simulator (MOCARTS)

MOCARTS is a light weight radiator transport simulator inspired on Oregon Medical Laser Center's mcml, that eases some of the interface limitations of mcml. In particular, (i) it provides a flexible way to describe biological tissues in a more intuitive and reusable manner, (ii) it provides support to define and simulate multiple light sources and detectors that can be arranged in complex sensing geometries, and (iii) the formatting and organization of the input and output data is redefined over a more human-readable XML file format.
